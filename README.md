## Instructions

This project uses Node.js and npm, so make sure that they are both installed in your machine. The following dependencies were added to this project:
- express
- node-fetch
- axios
- lodash
- moment
- react
- react-dom
- react-paginate
- react-router
- react-router-dom

Start by accessing the directory `movie-search` from the terminal, then run `npm install` to make sure server-side dependencies are loaded. Then navigate into the directory `client`, and run `npm install` once more to do the same for client-side dependencies.

After npm finishes installing, navigate into the `server` directory, and then run the command `node server.js` to start up the Express server. If all is running as expected, you should see the message 'PORT 5000' at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser. Lastly, cd into `client` and run the command `npm start`. Then head over to http://localhost:3000 and start your movie searching fun :)
